# Javascript_Todo_Exercise
Just a little todo list done as an exercise to learn Javascript, html, and CSS. Items do not persist.

I would like to see if I can get the todo list to export a text file of items into this repo, and then read from those items upon opening. That way we can have persistant items, and if I host the list on github pages the list will be composed of items added by mandom passers by in the event that there are any. All items would be publicly visible, so there will be some input sanitization capability added in the event that I can get the GIT functionality working.

Thanks for stopping by!
